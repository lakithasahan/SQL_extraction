    1. Create ER Diagram 
        a. https://dataedo.com/kb/tools/datagrip/create-database-diagram
    2. Get table record counts
        a. SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'ezypos' order by TABLE_ROWS DESC;
    3. Reduced the number of required fields of the following linked tables
        a. Payments 
        b. Products
        c. Receipts
        d. Ticketlines
        e. Tickets
            i. Required fields (10) are shown in the Tableau workbook. Datasource=ticketlines step3
    4. Used SQLs/Tableau to verify the relationships of the tables found in 3
        a. In payments
            i. If there is a numerical TRANSID, PAYMENT is always magcard and vice-versa
            ii. If PAYMENT is cash or free TRANSID is always ‘no ID’
            iii. If PAYMENT is cashin or cashrefunds TRANSID is always NULL
            iv. No other possibility for TRANSID field
            v. RETURNMSG is NULL if PAYMENT is msgcard or cashin and vice-versa
            vi. RETURNMSG is OK otherwise
            vii. No other possibility for RETURNMSG field

        b. In ticketlines, LINE is an item in the invoice. 
            i. TICKET and  LINE in  ticketlines make a unique key
                1. SELECT MIN(DIFF), MAX(DIFF) FROM (SELECT TICKET,MAX(LINE) - COUNT(*) DIFF FROM ticketlines GROUP BY  TICKET) AS A
                2. SELECT TICKET, LINE, COUNT(*) CNT FROM ticketlines GROUP BY  TICKET, LINE HAVING CNT !=1
            ii. ticketlines.TICKET=tickets.ID=receipts.ID=payment.RECEIPT 
                1. Therefore, payment.RECEIPT=ticketlines.TICKET
                    a. Tables tickets and receipts can be omitted when not used
                    b. receipts table contains the date in DATENEW field
                    c. Required fields (8) are shown in the Tableau workbook. Datasource=ticketlines
                2.   TAXID filed 001 => 0.1 tax rate, else 0 tax rate. Corressponds to 10% GST on some items
                3. Tallying item prices and payments:
SELECT TICKET, PA, P, PA-P DIFF FROM (SELECT RECEIPT, SUM(TOTAL) AS PA FROM payments GROUP BY RECEIPT) A, (SELECT TICKET, SUM(UNITS * PRICE * IF(TAXID='001', 1.1, 1)) P FROM ticketlines GROUP BY TICKET) B WHERE A.RECEIPT=B.TICKET.	

    5. As there can be multiple payments for an invoice, the following two data sources were made in Tableau
        a. Invoices 
        b. Payments
    6. For sales and revenue forecasting,  the following sql can be used to extract data.
SELECT TICKET, PRODUCT,pdcts.NAME, UNITS, PRICE, TAXID, DATENEW, pymnts.PAYMENT
FROM ticketlines tls, receipts rcpts, products pdcts,payments pymnts
WHERE tls.TICKET=rcpts.ID AND tls.PRODUCT=pdcts.ID AND pymnts.RECEIPT=tls.TICKET
